# Cosmopolitan Night City - DIY Edition

DIY-CNC is a software tool that lets you create a fully personalized multilingual experience, just like the ["Cosmopolitan Night City"](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5909) mod, but it's fully customizable. Select which characters switch languages, enjoy all the advanced features, specify exactly which audio and subtitle languages you need, and benefit from full integration of ["Polyglot V"](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/9275) and ["Change V's native Language"](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5718).


## üõ†Ô∏è About the Code

DIY-CNC is a Python-based graphical tool with an easy-to-use interface built with **Tkinter**.

The tool provides full control over localization customization, allowing users to:
- Select which audio localization to modify,
- Select which subtitle language to modify,
- Choose which characters switch languages individually.

It also automates complex file manipulations such as:
- Processing and merging **voiceover** files from different localizations of the game into a new customized set,
- Handling **lipsync** animations and generating **lipmaps** based on the combined voiceover files,
- Updating **voiceover maps** to prevent **misgendered issues** caused by file replacements,
- Updating **dialogue durations** to prevent **speech-cutting issues** after merging different localizations,
- Editing **subtitle files** to match custom configurations and applying a **Kiroshi translation effect** on the newly added lines,
- Cleaning up intermediate files to prepare the project for final mod packaging with external tools like **WolvenKit**.

There are several plugins that allow for further customization of the "CVL extensions," such as the Fusion_CVL_PV plugin, the KiroshiTranslationeffect_forCVL plugin, and the TransVmultilingualvoice_forCVL plugin, among others. More information can be found on the Nexusmods page.
