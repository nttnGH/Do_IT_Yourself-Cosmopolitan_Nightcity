# Cosmopolitan Night City - DIY Edition

DIY-CNC is a software tool that lets you create a fully personalized multilingual experience, just like the ["Cosmopolitan Night City"](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5909) mod and ["Polyglot V"] mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/9275), but it's fully customizable. Select which characters switch languages, and with whom V is polyglot (with an AI or VA voice), enjoy all the advanced features (kiroshi translation effect, correct vomap, correct dialogue duration), specify exactly which audio and subtitle languages you need, and benefit from full integration with extension ["Change V's native Language"](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5718).


## üõ†Ô∏è About the Code

DIY-CNC is a Python-based graphical tool with an easy-to-use interface built with **Tkinter**.

The tool provides full control over localization customization, allowing users to:
- Select which audio localization to modify,
- Select which subtitle language to modify,
- Choose which characters switch languages individually,
- Choose with whom V switch language.

It also automates complex file manipulations such as:
- Processing and merging **voiceover** files from different localizations of the game into a new customized set,
- Handling **lipsync** animations and generating **lipmaps** based on the combined voiceover files,
- Updating **voiceover maps** to prevent **misgendered issues** caused by file replacements,
- Updating **dialogue durations** to prevent **speech-cutting issues** after merging different localizations,
- Editing **subtitle files** to match custom configurations and applying a **Kiroshi translation effect** on the newly added lines,
- Cleaning up intermediate files to prepare the project for final mod packaging with external tools like **WolvenKit**.
